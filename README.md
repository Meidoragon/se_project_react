[Link to back end](https://github.com/Meidoragon/se_project_express)

## Overview
 * Intro
 * Technologies Used
 * Future plans

## Intro
  This is the front end portion of WTWR, a web app designed to suggest clothing of to wear based off of the weather.

## Technologies Used
  * Component based rendering, and state management with React
  * Route management with React Router

## Future Plans
  * Implement user-defined locations from which to pull weather data -AND-OR- use geocoding to get the user's current location, and use that.
  * Find a way to de-stringify some of the things that are more akin to enums (primarily the weather codes and the ActiveModal)
