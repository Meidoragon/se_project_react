  This is the front end portion of WTWR, a web app designed to suggest clothing of to wear based off of the weather.

## Technologies Used

## Future Plans
  * Implement user-defined locations from which to pull weather data -AND-OR- use geocoding to get the user's current location, and use that.
  * When user presses the 'Sign Up' button from the 'Login' modal or vice versa, it maintains what they may have placed in the Email and Password fields when the switch occurs
  * Implement stricter password requirements (ex. must include X number of different character types)
